Mexico:
“Corrupt practices developed primarily due to Mexico’s long standing relationship with oligarchy and authoritarian rule. Because the country was ruled under a single party known as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) until the year 2000, politicians could very easily use bribes in exchange for votes and other forms of support. Corruption was able to flourish quickly as there were not many ways for the public to combat this system. As this information became increasingly publicized, the Mexican government garnered a reputation of being notoriously opaque.  

Hierarchy within both government and Mexican society became standard and was largely influenced by Mexico’s geographic relationship with the United States. This relationship ultimately became the catalyst of many forces within organized crime and drug trafficking between them. When the National Action Party (PAN) came into power in 2000, efforts were made in curbing these issues as well as undergoing major processes of structural reform, however they ultimately succumbed to their inexperience, which allowed for newer conflicts to easily go unnoticed. These futile responses are also due to the heavy influence that PRI has held over law, policy, and economics since 1946, which had almost become synonymous with the development of these sectors. 

Despite many reports of military-initiated abuse, government scandal, and heavy media censorship (the lowest press freedom rating in Latin America), PRI came back into power in 2012 and is still met with many of the issues it left behind. Because of its 12 year absence, there are widespread suspicions concerning the possibility of electoral fraud throughout Mexico’s 2018 election.”

Brazil
“Brazil is often considered one of the most widespread examples of political and economic corruption within Latin America. Bribery, nepotism, and the dishonesty of politicians are standard yet root many of the political issues the country faces. Public embezzlement, primarily through overbilling, is one of Brazil’s greatest issues and largely demonstrates the relationship between the Brazilian government and its people. This practice allows for political figures to quickly gain exponential amounts of money, which are often used to fuel campaigns and ulterior political agendas. 

While there are many examples of situations such as these, the measurement of corruption within Brazil is difficult to measure as these practices are deeply ingrained within the country’s landscape. As a result, many of these instances go uninvestigated and unprosecuted. State-run oil company Petrobras is a prime illustration of this conflict, as its relationship to money laundering is currently under investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil.

This investigation has faced its own controversy, however, as Brazilian Police forces have faced accusations of selective justice and has been guilty of public defense violations in its past. To combat further dishonesty, policies such as the Clean Company Act were created to further restrict on laws around fraud and bribery.”

Honduras
“Due to an economy that is largely dictated by clientelism, all sectors of the country’s economy are known for some form corrupt practice. As Honduras has been met with a steady decline in its international market value, it has faced a number of blows to its own governmental function. An underfunded judiciary system, inexperienced staff, and a convoluted import and export practice are just a few points that have exhibited increasing issues. 

Since these disparities naturally influence the rise of malpractice, the Honduran government made sure to establish its own anti-corruption framework in an effort to combat this. Unfortunately, the laws created under this framework have since been recognized to be largely ineffective and only provide a tiny filter to many of the issues the economy is met with. 

The police force in Honduras are notorious for their abusive power regime, often times directly neglecting areas with the highest crime rates and possessing little to no authority over governmental and institutional crime. Additionally, a National Security Emergency was brought upon Honduras in 2016, as it was discovered that the police force held many ties to the various facets of organized crime. The issue has since been investigated and resulted in prosecution, though it has since caused a great deal of public uproar.

Honduran border control is also known for corrupt practices and is often dominated by bribery. The government has also been criticized for restricting a freedom of press, though it is notably more tame than other Latin American countries.”


Guatemala
“While Guatemala has a system of law that is relevant to many of the issues it faces individually, government officials are often guilty of their personal involvement with corrupt practices. Bribery and gift-giving are widespread practices in both the political landscape as well as the country’s judiciary branch. While the two are both detrimental to the standing of Guatemala as a whole, the latter is where the country is met with a great deal of negative impact. 

Because many rulings are affected by these practices, the efficiency of the judiciary branch as a whole is slowed immensely. Not only is this greatly ineffective, but many guilty companies and institutions are exempt from legal consequence entirely due to extremely lengthy contract enforcing processes (currently up to 1,400 days). 

The police force in Guatemala has a reputation of ignoring business related crime as well, though they are also heavily criticized for their negligence towards violent crime. This is also a notably underfunded police force and largely lacks the resources for proper operations.

Corruption regarding customs has been a point of notoriety in the nation’s past and has since made the formation of international transactions and relationships a recurring issue.”

Venezuela
“Venezuela is undoubtedly one of the most prevalent and publicized examples of governmental, societal, and economic corruption. It is widely regarded as the most corrupt country in Latin America and continues to face multiplying effects of an economic collapse. The discovery and production of oil in Venezuela has become a major force in the country’s economic downfall, which has also afforded it the highest inflation rate in the world (5,200% and rising).

Though the country possessed one of the strongest economies in South America throughout the entire second half of the 20th century, inequality slowly crept into society when an increasing disparity between the wealthy and the poor allowed the Venezuelan elite to control the majority of the country’s resources. Hugo Chávez’s socialist platform introduced upon his rise to power in 1999 seemed like the answer to most, though this plan quickly became the source of extreme overspending and a drastic economic shift from agriculture to the sale of oil. Additionally, over 22.5 billion dollars was reportedly moved off-shore for “personal use” and remains unaccounted for entirely. These practices were ultimately reinforced by successor Nicolás Maduro from 2013 onward, though by this point the country had already begun its economic tailspin. 

Maduro accepted millions in bribes as the country’s debts rapidly piled up. This became quite ineffective as oil prices began to drop significantly, leaving Venezuela with about half of its original income. After being met with hostility and offered little to nothing in return by Venezuela, many foreign buyers and businesses drastically cut back funding or abandoned the country entirely. The Venezuelan government later would attempt to combat this situation by printing new money, rendering the country’s inflation rate essentially irreparable. 

As matters worsened, the effects on Venezuelan society quickly followed. Statistics concerning the true state of the economy were no longer published, leaving the majority of Venezuelans unsure of the situation themselves. Extreme inflation rates have rendered the currency nearly worthless, despite the fact that minimum prices for essential items remain unaffordable. Food, medicine, and housing shortages are rampant and the majority of the public is malnourished. Over 2 million citizens have left the country entirely since 1999, which is also somewhat restricted as many airlines and travel services have cut ties with the country entirely (though even these options are still unaffordable for many). Venezuela’s violent crime rates have simultaneously skyrocketed, now regarded as the highest in the world. Less than 2% of reported crimes are prosecuted.”

Argentina
“Corruption is an ongoing issue that Argentina has faced since its independence. Though the country possesses the legal framework strong enough to combat its effects, it has consistently faced poor governmental practices throughout its history. 

The majority of the corruption issues the country faces pertain to economic, judicial, and administrative sectors, and the Argentinian public widely acknowledges the legacy of corrupt governance and dishonest policy that is upheld. The government’s poor reputation has been earned through an endless list of scandals and controversies, often related to economics or illegal practices. The latter is actually said by many to be encouraged, particularly bank fraud and tax evasion. Argentinian government is also known for a severe lack of public access to its information. 

The country is also known for its highly politicized police force; one that is known for evading proper practices of law and still holds a great deal of influence from Jorge Videla’s dictatorship throughout the 1970s and ‘80s.”

Colombia
“Corruption plays a large part in all sectors of Colombian society and functions as a direct adaptation of the corrupt practices since the original Spanish colonies arrived on its soil. These practices are particularly evident within the judicial and bureaucratic sectors of the nation. 

Though Colombia struggles with issues such as drug trafficking, low surveillance, and an ongoing paramilitary conflict, the most evident is the glaringly obvious corruption among the country’s own government. Not only is the crime rate within the Colombian government over four times larger than that of the general public, but the amount of incredibility throughout the government’s history has birthed a majority of public apathy within the nation. 

Countless political scandals have risen in the past decade alone and the majority of them are fueled by bribery, money laundering, and extortion. Though the country has a notable tolerance for the freedom of press, assembly rights are quite limited and has been labeled “dangerous” in terms of civil society.”

Bolivia
“Corruption runs through all sectors of Bolivian society and is said to exist as an accepted part of life. Despite this public awareness, a great deal of Bolivians do not possess the resources or education regarding the protections of their own rights or against corrupt law.

Bolivia has been consistently unstable since its independence. This is largely due to its unusually weak government, which has been overthrown hundreds of times. The judicial branch and the police force are often considered the most corrupt facets of Bolivian society, with the latter being notorious for its poor training and low pay rates. Bolivia also remains the most impoverished nation in South America, with over 60% of its population lying below the poverty line. Though there have been considerable improvements to the economy since Evo Morales’ presidency, amendments made have ultimately granted the government further control. Bolivia’s natural gas reserves have also become enveloped in controversy concerning exploitative economic practices. For these many reasons, the public opinion on Bolivia varies greatly from person to person. 

Interestingly enough, bribery is completely illegal in Bolivia yet the majority of its government is fueled by the practice. Over half of the country’s public prosecutors were suspended in 2014 for this reason as well as other related offenses. The country is known as one of the larger drug trafficking hubs of South America, which much of the police force has been involved with since the 1950s. Though the country has put many anti-corruption laws into place, they are often quite vague and rarely enforced. 

Haiti
“Haiti has had a long term struggle with corruption that has greatly impeded upon its ability to function as a sustainable nation. The country is known as the poorest country in the western hemisphere, with over a quarter of its population living in extreme poverty. Public law was already widely regarded as ineffective, though this worsened tremendously following the earthquake of 2010 and the impact of Hurricane Matthew in 2016. 

Due to the devastating effects of these natural disasters and ineffective presidential economic plans, the country’s finances are nearly bankrupt. Haiti has a heavy reliance on foreign aid and there is very little room for economic mobility within its markets, which is already dominated by the elite. 

Police in Haiti are known to regularly abuse power and are heavily involved with organized and politically motivated crime. Additionally, numerous past presidents have been convicted of serious and dangerous crimes. Many constitutional practices are broken throughout these processes yet remain unprosecuted. The judicial sector is very ineffective and allows for high crime rates both inside and outside of the government. Though anti-corruption laws have been put into action, they are widely disregarded and rarely enforced.”

Ecuador
“Ecuadorian corruption is rampant and is said to impede on the basic human rights of its population. The country is subject to a great deal of nepotism, with many governmental positions being filled by underqualified political allies. This allows for corrupt practices to spread quickly and unforgivingly. It is said that the country loses over $2 billion a year due to poor practices. 

Ecuador’s completely opaque government allows for a widely misinformed population and little to no room for resistance. Justice is greatly flawed in the country, with an abundance of evidence outlining the negligence of the judicial branch in regards to prosecuting corruption charges. This may be a result of the fact that Ecuadorian judges do not act independently in their decisions, in conjunction with lengthy and inconclusive court proceedings. The police force is also known for being underfunded and poorly recruited. 

Ecuadorian media is said to be “filtered by the state”, though this is technically illegal. This also plays a role in the inability of anti-corruption movements in gaining momentum. Many of the laws put in place to fight government corruption were once said to be useful, though they have been criticized for their weakening throughout Correa’s presidency from 2007 to 2017.
