                <p>Economics - “Development and economic growth has historically been a very slow process. Many countries have been met with wealth inequality and political instability since gaining independence and have often become common traits within their economic landscape. Public programs and manufacturing industries have since become prime points of investment.”

                </br>
Income Inequality - “Latin America is widely regarded as one of the world’s most unequal regions in terms of income. Though there has been a steady decline in inequality rates since 2000, it remains staggered by factors such as a widespread reliance on the import/export of commodities and the rise of minimum wages. Ineffective tax systems and limited access to education also work against efforts to close this immense gap.”

International organizations created to work against various forms of corruption are the result of a high regional increase within the past 30 years. These organizations allow for enhanced public transparency via audits, disclosure agreements, more forms of government accountability, and less government discretion. However, it is up to each country individually to enforce these laws, which can ultimately affect their outcomes.

Latin American media is not always granted the freedoms that the first world is familiar with, with many reports being censored to varying degrees. In recent years, a societal shift towards the internet and social media as a means of documentation and political expression has played a large role in the state of the region’s public information and resistance movements. Of course, this is also affected by each nation’s public access to technology and the opacity of its government. Often times political uncertainty is considered the norm and the means of its response are ever changing.</p>
