                <p>High crime insecurity rates exist among much of the Latin American population. The region is home to the majority of the world’s homicides, which ultimately plays a large role in many nation’s wealth and inequality. Instability and migration are also factors of these significant economic costs.
                </br>
                </br>
Despite the fact that the region has some of the world’s highest crime rates per capita, a great deal of the crimes counted will go untried. This is especially true for political and government related crimes, though is also true for violent and domestic accounts.

                </br>
Public opinions on security vastly differ among person to person, so it can be difficult for many causes to establish a common political ground. However, regardless of the accuracy of public opinion, many nations within the region suffer from deficient information systems. This can deeply affect how the public views a given nation because it can cause much of the collected data to be unreliable based on varying degrees of inaccuracy.

                </br>
A scattered understanding of crime patterns and the core issues these high rates calls for a drastic improvement of crime studies and their focal points. Domestic violence against women and crime within the police force are a few strong examples. Prosecution for crimes and possible alternatives could also work to the benefit of Latin America and future research.
