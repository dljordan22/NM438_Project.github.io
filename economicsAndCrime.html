                <p>Development and economic growth has historically been a very slow process. Many countries have been met with wealth inequality and political instability since gaining independence and have often become common traits within their economic landscape. Public programs and manufacturing industries have since become prime points of investment. High crime insecurity rates exist among much of the Latin American population. The region is home to the majority of the world’s homicides, which ultimately plays a large role in many nation’s wealth and inequality. Instability and migration are also factors of these significant economic costs.</p>
