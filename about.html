                <p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong>
                </br>
                </br>
                    The LACC (Latin American Corruption Crusade) is a web project created to outline many of the struggles and difficulties Latin America faces while highlighting corruption being a particular focus. The project strives to not only bridge gaps such as language barriers and geographical complications, but also to present a convenient digital gateway for outside audiences to connect with the region and its people.
                </br>
                </br>
                Though of course there are many resources to learn about Latin America present elsewhere on the web, LACC stands out as a unique introduction to the region’s issues in its collective presentation. The project grants users the material to make their own conclusion
s about Latin American issues but ensures that its perspectives feel both lived and personal. 
                </br>
                </br>
                With the region facing a wide variety of social issues that pertain to the economic, legislative, and political sectors of society, a common concern initially is finding the root of them. As many of the region’s nations are underdeveloped, political corruption is able to flourish easily because of the disadvantages some countries may face in these same sectors.
