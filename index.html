            <p>Political scandal and injustice have become long-term conflicts since many Latin American countries have declared independence. Crime often makes its way into office through relations with powerful elites. Government is typically influenced by some degree of bribery, which causes elections and political proceedings to be subject to bias and dishonesty. In effect, this allows for these corrupt practices to spread rapidly in other facets of society.

            </br>
        In addition to constantly fluctuating economies, high rates of poverty, and longstanding histories of organized crime, Latin America often faces a wide variety of social issues that pertain to the economic, legislative, and political conflicts. The results of these factors have often led to various waves of political resistance and a dizzying dissemination of political info both inside and outside each nation. Each nation typically has garnered its own unique societal unrest that is unique to its own leadership and agenda.</p>
