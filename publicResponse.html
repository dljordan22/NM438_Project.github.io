                <p>Latin America has been a land of resistance to all forms of oppression since the arrival of westerners. These problems often correlate with the spread of capitalism and neoliberalism, and largely work at the expense of indigenous, impoverished, and non-white individuals. Reform programs and Resistance movements are often spearheaded by these same groups, working to end basic governmental negligence and the oligarchies in which they are born under.

International organizations created to work against various forms of corruption are the result of a high regional increase within the past 30 years. These organizations allow for enhanced public transparency via audits, disclosure agreements, more forms of government accountability, and less government discretion. However, it is up to each country individually to enforce these laws, which can ultimately affect their outcomes.

Latin American media is not always granted the freedoms that the first world is familiar with, with many reports being censored to varying degrees. In recent years, a societal shift towards the internet and social media as a means of documentation and political expression has played a large role in the state of the region’s public information and resistance movements. Of course, this is also affected by each nation’s public access to technology and the opacity of its government. Often times political uncertainty is considered the norm and the means of its response are ever changing.
