	<p>Latin America has been a land of resistance to all forms of oppression since the arrival of westerners. These problems often correlate with the spread of capitalism and neoliberalism, and largely work at the expense of indigenous, impoverished, and non-white individuals. Reform programs and Resistance movements are often spearheaded by these same groups, working to end basic governmental negligence and the oligarchies in which they are born under.</p>
